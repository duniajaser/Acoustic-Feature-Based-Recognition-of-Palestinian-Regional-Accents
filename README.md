#   Acoustic-Feature-Based-Recognition-of-Palestinian-Regional-Accents

This repository contains the code and documentation for our project on recognizing Palestinian regional accents using acoustic features. Developed as part of the Spoken Language Processing course at Birzeit University, this project focuses on distinguishing between accents from Hebron, Jerusalem, Nablus, and Ramallah using machine learning models.

## Project Overview

Our project employs Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to extract features from audio data, with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models used for classification.
